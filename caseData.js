It says that if the violation involves<blockquote>100 kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of marihuana, or 100 or more marihuana plants regardless of weight</blockquote><blockquote>...such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 5 years and not more than 40 years...</blockquote>The local media had reported an estimated 500 plants, so he was likely well above 100.
